Welcome to the Great Library of Alexandria. 
This is a collection of Python libraries that I've published, which I found to be really helpful in my day-to-day job as a data analyst/scientist/machine learning engineer/consultant.

### 1. Lesley
Lesley is a library to show heatmaps on calendar data. It is heavily inspired by another package called July, but instead of matplotlib, Lesley uses Altair as the base visualization library. This enables built-in interactivity, such as tooltips, which are really helpful when doing exploratory analysis.

### 2. Floryn
Floryn is a library to plot text filled in percentage, instead of fully. This can be used to highlight the difference or ratio between several values or metrics. For example, showing the quota progress between each quarter.

### 3. Raftel
Raftel is a library to plot S2ID on the map. S2ID is a way to perform geospatial analysis by dividing the world into a quadtree. 
More about S2ID and its differences compared to other algorithms such as geohash or H3 can be learned further in this article: https://benfeifke.com/posts/geospatial-indexing-explained/

### 4. Monochromap
Monochromap is a library to plot on top of a black and white map, or what we in the industry call the Stamen Toner tile style. 
This particular color scheme, instead of the default theme by map providers, makes it easier to highlight certain geographical features like points of interest.

This collection is made with a huge amount of caffeine, so if you find any of these tools to be useful, consider treating me to a caramel macchiato to continue the development.
